## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Discord:
- Deleting and Editting Messages.
- Creating large groupchats with voice chat.
- Creating higher roles for people in chat (Mods).

Snapchat:
- Allowing others to know when someone screenshots your post.
- The use of characters that appear when both parties are in chat.

Instragram:
- Being able to change the theme to different images.
- Liking/Reacting to messages and storys.
- Ability to change the chat bubble color.

Crunchyroll:
- Recommended list
- Ability to save and start where you last stopped watching

I would like to create an app that would allow people to play a new form of game that uses multiple people in order to play through it. It would be a form of choose your own adventure book but within app form. I would like to implement things such as a role system like discord which can better set the landscape, and have those go through it as if they were truly in the story. I would also want to implement the changing of themes, large groups to have bigger games, and effects that could appear through messages to give a sense that one is within the world fighting one another. An app that would allow others to not allow message their friends and family, but also play with them as though they are play Dungeons and Dragons through the phone. Also implementing private chat when one does not want to play. 

## Notes

There were no overwhelming challenges that wasn't already explained by the pre-work, therefore this was an easy task to overcome.
